# keywords made from scratch to see if function works, waiting for the list from the group :3

excluding_keywords = [
  "unknown",
  "probable",
  "putative",
]

including_keywords = [
  "activity",
  "catalyzes",
  "binds",
  "mediates",
  "hydrolyzes",
  "transfers",
  "catalytic",
  "binds",
  "involved in",
]

### GUYS READ THIS: criteria was made by looking at random sequences from "ecoli.csv" file, there excluding keywords imo should stay, including keywords can be changed/improved
